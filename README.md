# Car-Crash-Detector
<p>This is the setup and code of a device which detects any harm to vehicle and alerts the friends/relative/family members(i.e whose phone number is stored on IFTT) of the concerned.
This project uses IFTTT and use of AT commands of esp8266.
The repository contains both arduino codes i.e one when we use ESP8266 Esp-01 as a standalone and other when we use it with arduino.
Connections can be seen from images.
